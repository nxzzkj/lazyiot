Advance Syntax/Schedule and Coverage:

CQs operate on realtime data.With the advanced syntax, CQs use the local server’s timestamp, the information in the RESAMPLE clause,
and InfluxDB’s preset time boundaries to determine when to execute and what time range to cover in the query.

CQs execute at the same interval as the EVERY interval in the RESAMPLE clause, and they run at the start of InfluxDB’s preset time
boundaries. If the EVERY interval is two hours, InfluxDB executes the CQ at the top of every other hour.

When the CQ executes, it runs a single query for the time range between now() and now() minus the FOR interval in the RESAMPLE
clause. If the FOR interval is two hours and the current time is 17:00, the query’s time range is between 15:00 and 16:59.999999999.

Both the EVERY interval and the FOR interval accept duration literals. The RESAMPLE clause works with either or both of the EVERY
and FOR intervals configured. CQs default to the relevant basic syntax behavior if the EVERY interval or FOR interval is not provided.

Use an EVERY interval and FOR interval in the RESAMPLE clause to specify the CQ’s execution interval and the length of the CQ’s time range:

  RESAMPLE EVERY 1h FOR 90m
